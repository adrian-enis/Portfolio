        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-justify text-lg">
        I am a software development professional with over five years of experience focused on the e-commerce sector. My career has evolved from specialized front-end roles, where I perfected the creation of high-impact, interactive user interfaces with React.js and TypeScript, to becoming a full-stack developer capable of designing and managing complete architectures with the MERN stack and cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js and Prisma.
        I specialize in platform transformation, migrating legacy systems to modern solutions that dramatically improve SEO, load speed, and user experience. My focus is on code quality and robustness, applying end-to-end data validation and adopting best practices to ensure project scalability and maintainability. I constantly seek to solve complex problems, optimize performance, and collaborate on teams that drive technological innovation.
