        Hi, I'm Adrian, a Front-End Developer with over four years of experience
        in creating and optimizing digital platforms for e-commerce businesses.
        My background combines academic knowledge with continuous learning in
        key web development technologies. I specialize in designing modern,
        efficient, and accessible interfaces using tools like React, TypeScript,
        and TailwindCSS. I help companies achieve their goals by implementing
        solutions that enhance user experience and optimize website performance.
        From API integrations to load and performance optimization, my focus is
        on boosting platform visibility on the web and ensuring smooth
        navigation for users. I'm always seeking new challenges that allow me to
        keep growing and bring value to innovative digital projects.
